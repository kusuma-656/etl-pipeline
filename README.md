# ETL Pipeline Project

## Description
This project contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file, performs data transformations, and loads the data into an SQLite database. The pipeline is implemented in Python and makes use of libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `sqlite3` for database interaction.

## Features
- **Extract:** Extracts data from a CSV file.
- **Transform:** Cleans, filters, and transforms data (e.g., removes duplicates, handles missing values).
- **Load:** Loads the transformed data into an SQLite database.
